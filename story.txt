Let us listen to a story.

In the bustling town of Quirkville, there was a barber named Mr. Snip, renowned for his incredible speed. He boasted he could give anyone a perfect haircut in just five minutes. One day, a new customer named Mr. Swift, skeptical but amused, decided to test Mr. Snip’s claim.

Mr. Swift sat in the chair, and Mr. Snip started snipping away, scissors flying with precision. True to his word, exactly five minutes later, the haircut was done. Mr. Swift looked in the mirror, impressed by the flawless cut.

"Remarkable!" Mr. Swift exclaimed. "But, how do you manage such speed?"

Mr. Snip chuckled and replied, "Well, sir, I always keep my best pair of scissors sharp and ready for the job."

As Mr. Swift reached for his wallet, he realized his head felt unusually light. He looked down and saw his wallet on the floor, neatly sliced in half, its contents strewn everywhere.

Mr. Snip grinned, “Sharp scissors indeed, sir. That'll be fifty dollars.
